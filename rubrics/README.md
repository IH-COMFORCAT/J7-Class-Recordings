## Rubrics

In order to assess your project and ensure all requirements are met, a **rubric** will be used. This rubric is used to **evaluate your project** by your teaching staff but also to **communicate** what constitutes incomplete, acceptable and excellent performance across each of the learning outcomes for this project. Take some time to review the rubric and ask your lead teacher any questions about it if necessary.



| **Learning outcomes**                                        | **Domains**                                               | **0 - Incomplete**                                           | **1 - Fair**                                                 | **2 - Good**                                                 | **3 - Excellent**                                            |

| ***Create a REST API having all CRUD operations***           | Server-side development, Databases, Software Architecture | Student failed to implement the basic REST API features. Student showed no evidence of creating a database or created a database with less than two tables. Custom routes are either missing or only provide basic CRUD actions (GET & POST). | Student implemented a REST API, but with an incomplete set of features. The REST API includes a database. Routes have been partially completed, with at most three out of four CRUD actions available. | Student created a REST API with the full set of features. The schema is well-defined with a partially implemented validation. All of the REST API routes are tested with an API Testing tool (Postman, Insomnia or similar). | Student successfully implemented a REST API with the full set of features following best practices. Student created a database and has implemented all CRUD actions on multiple resources. The schema is robust with well-defined data types and validation. All of the REST API routes are tested with an API Testing tool (Postman, Insomnia or similar). Server-side input validation is implemented on all the routes. |
| ***Properly create models and relationships***               | Server-side development, Databases, Software Architecture | Student failed to create all the models needed and implement the basic relationship between models. Inheritance and composition are not present in any model. | Student created all models with some relationships between models. Inheritance and composition are not present or partially present in the models. Property names are not consistent or do not follow the best practices and naming conventions. | Student adequately created all models needed with their relationships. Inheritance and composition are present in some models. Property names are consistent and follow the best practices and naming conventions. | Student adequately created all models needed for their relationships. Inheritance and composition are present in some models. There are not any unneeded bi-directional relationships. Property names are consistent and follow the best practices and naming conventions. |
| ***Implement Authentication and Authorization***             | Server-side development                                   | Student didn’t implement the authentication and authorization on their project. | Student implemented the basic authentication and authorization. Student partially secured the routes, with some critical routes being unprotected or unnecessarily protected. | Student adequately implemented the authentication and authorization in a full-stack application. Student secured all routes well, providing access to the parts of the application based on the authentication status. | Student successfully implemented the authentication and authorization. Student secured all routes well, providing access to the parts of the application based on the authentication status. In addition, the student incorporated a role-based authorization. |
| ***Test the functionalities of the application***            | Server-side development, Testing, Code Quality            | Student didn't create any tests (0% test coverage).          | Student created very few tests so the bare minimum of the application is being tested (<50% test coverage). | Student managed to create tests for some of the functionalities in the application (50-80% test coverage). | Student successfully created tests for the majority of functionalities of the application (>80% test coverage). |
| ***Properly handle exceptions and errors***                  | Server-side development                                   | Student didn't implement error handling.                     | Student only applied generic error responses, or he/she didn't properly handle errors. | Student handles most of the errors properly but uses generic classes as Exception to catch every exception instead of using the specific ones. | Student successfully implemented a robust error handling over wrong calls to endpoints parameters or data types with specific messages. |
| ***Write clean, modular, and efficient code following best practices*** | Code Quality                                              | Student has not followed best practices in writing clean, modular and efficient code. Student has unused code in the project and functions that are considered too large or perform multiple tasks. Student has not followed a consistent approach in naming the structure and organization of the files/folder. Student has not applied indentation conventions making the code hard to read. | Student has named files and folders logically and has organized them clearly and consistently. Student has partially applied indentation conventions to the source code and has mostly named functions and variables logically. Some unused code is within the project. | Student has adequately named files and folders and has organized them clearly and consistently. Student has also applied indentation conventions to the source code and has named functions and variables logically. Student used advanced approaches to extract values from complex data structures to enhance code readability. There is no unused code within the project and utility functions are contained in separate self-descriptive files. | Student has adequately named all files and folders and has organized them clearly and consistently. Student has applied indentation conventions to the source code and was meticulous in commenting the code. Student has named functions and variables logically following the industry conventions. There is no unused code within the project and utility functions are contained in separate self-descriptive files. Student used advanced approaches to enhance code readability. Student abstracted part of the application login into services. |
| ***Document the application's features, configuration, and technical specifications. Deliver a simplified Class Diagram and Use Case Diagram***. | Career development                                        | Student didn’t make any attempt to document the project’s specifications. | Student provided a partially completed project README. Student has only partially documented the application’s features, configuration or specifications in the README file. Student didn’t make Class nor Use Case Diagram or diagrams are created but they are not following UML syntax. | Student has created a well-structured and clear README file that covers all of the application’s features, configuration and specifications. Student has included credits, clearly listing any collaborators, team members and resources used that contributed to the project. Student created Class and Use Case diagrams but there are some differences between the diagrams and the final code. | Student has created a fully comprehensive and well-structured README file that not only clearly communicates the application’s features, configuration and specifications but goes into further detail justifying the choice for inclusion in the application. The student has added a license to the file and included credits, clearly listing any collaborators, team members and resources used that contributed to the project as well as badges. Class and Use Case diagrams have been made and define the system clearly. |
| ***BONUS: Deploy a functioning project to a Cloud service*** | Server-side development                                   | Student failed to deploy an application to a predefined Cloud service. The application can’t be accessed through the publicly available URL and/or the error message is shown. | Student deployed the applications to a Cloud service but some of the application features not working. Some API endpoints can be accessed through the publicly available URL, however, some functionalities are not available or result in an error message being shown. | Student deployed the applications to a Cloud service, with the app being fully operational. Some parts of the application can be accessed through the publicly available URL; however, some functionalities are not fully operational or have minor bugs. | Student successfully deployed the applications to a Cloud service, with the app being fully operational. All parts of the application are accessible through the publicly available URL. The deployed application is fully operational and new deployments don’t cause interruptions. |
| ***BONUS: Enhance the application solution with extra features (ex. fraud detection)*** | Server-side development                                   | Student didn't implement any extra features.                 | Student implemented some extra features that may be partially working or that it is shown that there has been an effort in the design and development of the solution. | Student implemented functional extra features that add value to the application. Extra features are properly tested and documented. | Student implemented fully functional extra features that add value to the application that goes beyond the scope of the project showing exceptional understanding of one or more concepts that were not covered in class (e.g. advanced data structures, advanced SQL queries, or secure coding practices). The extra features are properly tested and documented. |
